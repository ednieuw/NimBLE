# NimBLE
UART serial example programs for V1.4.3 and V2.x.x of NimBLE library

After NimBLE upgraden from 1.4.3 to version 2.x.x some functions needed extra command to operate.

These Arduino Nano ESP32 and probably also for other ESP32 MCU's sketches show the difference for the UART serial communication.
